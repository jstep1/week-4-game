Welcome to Crystal Collector! 

The objective of this game is to try to match your score with a randomly generated number. At the beginning of the game, the computer generates a target number. Each crystal is assigned a random number and the player must click the gems to increase their score.

In order to learn the value of each gem, the player must deduce information from the updated score. Once the score matches the target, the player wins. If their number goes above the target, they lose. The scoreboard then updates their win or loss, chooses new values for the target and gems and resets their score.
